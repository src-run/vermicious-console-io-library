 [Truman Capote (Breakfast at Tiffany's)] You call yourself a free spirit, a    
 'wild thing,' and you're terrified somebody's gonna stick you in a cage. Well  
 baby, you're already in that cage. You built it yourself. And it's not         
 bounded in the west by Tulip, Texas, or in the east by Somali-land. It's       
 wherever you go. Because no matter where you run, you just end up running      
 into yourself.
